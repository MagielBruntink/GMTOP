		<text>The Maschinenpistole 7 is a German personal defence weapon (PDW) designed and manufactured by Heckler &amp; Koch and chambered for the 4.6x30mm cartridge. It was designed with the new cartridge to meet NATO requirements published in 1989, as these requirements called for a personal defense weapon class firearm with a greater ability to penetrate body armor than current weapons that were limited to conventional pistol cartridges. The MP7 went into production in 2001 and has been a staple since.\n \n
