		<text>The 92F is perhaps best known as the standard pistol of the US Military, replacing the legendary M1911. It is a short-recoil operated, locked-breech weapon with an aluminium frame and a hard chromed barrel bore. A popular sidearm adopted by several countries, it is especially popular among criminals for its high-powered rounds and high-capacity magazine.\n \n
