		<text>Generates light by igniting a wick doused in kerosene. Lanterns are an uncommon light source amongst stalkers as fuel takes up weight and space that could otherwise be used for ammunition or priceless artefacts. Experienced stalkers that regularly travel along the path less trodden make use of these lamps for their hideouts.\n \n
