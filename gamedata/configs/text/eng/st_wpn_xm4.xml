		<text>The M4 Carbine descends from a family of firearms tracing its lineage back to earlier carbine versions of the M16, all based on the original AR-15 made by ArmaLite. It is a shorter and lighter version of the M16 assault rifle, sharing 80% of its parts. The M4 fires 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition and are gas operated, air cooled, magazine fed, selective fire firearms with a 4 position telescoping stock. As with many carbines, the M4 is handy and more convenient to carry than a full length rifle. It has been adopted by United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and is the preferred weapon of the U.S. Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs.\n \n

		%c[0,255,255,255]UNIQUE: %c[0,250,250,0] The XM4 Carbine was tested in June of 1983 by the United State Army's Armament Research and Development Center as a prototype and variant of the M16A2. Though 40 prototypes were granted to the Picatinny Arsenal in 1985, the XM4 ultimately lost funding in 1987 making this a very rare and unique weapon.\n
