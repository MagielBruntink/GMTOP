		<text>The SR-3 "Vikhr" ("Whirlwind") was based on the suppressed 9x39mm AS-Val assault rifle and intended for concealed carry by special VIP protection teams and State Security operatives. The SR-3M Vikhr is a result of combining the qualities of the SR-3, AS VAL and VSS Vintorez. The SR-3M also has a larger capacity of 30 rounds, which also provides more reliable feeding during automatic fire.\n \n
