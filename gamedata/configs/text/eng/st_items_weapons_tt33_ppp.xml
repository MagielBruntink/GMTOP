		<text>The Yugoslavian variant of the TT-33 from 1957 until 1992 offers a lot of improvements from the TT-33, including a longer frame, improving handling, and a longer magazine, allowing one more round to be loaded. Of important note, due to how it was engineered, it's easily possible to switch the caliber to 9x19.\n \n
